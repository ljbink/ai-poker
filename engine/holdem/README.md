## 🏗️ Core Types

### Player Structure
```go
type Player struct {
    poker.BasePlayer  // ID, Name
    cards    []*poker.Card
    chips    int
    bet      int
    totalBet int
    folded   bool
}
```

### Game Structure

type Game struct {
    Players               []*Player
    Deck                  poker.Cards

}
```

### Hand Evaluation
```go
type HandRank int

const (
    HighCard HandRank = iota
    OnePair
    TwoPair
    ThreeOfAKind

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Player Operations

#### Creation
```go
player := NewPlayer(id, name, startingChips)
```

#### Card Management
```go
player.DealCard(card)           // Add a card to hand
cards := player.GetHandCards()  // Get all cards
```

#### Chip Management
```go
chips := player.GetChips()      // Get current chips
player.GrandChips(amount)       // Add chips
player.Bet(amount)              // Bet chips
bet := player.GetBet()          // Get current bet
total := player.GetTotalBet()   // Get total bet this hand
```

#### Game State
```go
folded := player.IsFolded()     // Check if folded
player.Fold()                   // Fold the hand
player.ResetBet()               // Reset bet for new round
player.ResetForNewHand()        // Reset for new hand
```

#### Method Chaining
```go
// All modifier methods support chaining
player.DealCard(card1).
       DealCard(card2).
       Bet(50).
       ResetBet().
       GrandChips(100)
```

### Game Operations

```go
// Create game
game := holdem.NewGame([]string{"Alice", "Bob"}, 5, 10)

// Start hand
game.StartHand()

// Player actions
game.Call()         // Current player calls
game.Raise(20)      // Current player raises by 20
game.Check()        // Current player checks
game.Fold()         // Current player folds

// Advance phases
game.NextPhase()    // Preflop -> Flop -> Turn -> River -> Showdown

// Get info
currentPlayer := game.GetCurrentPlayer()
activePlayers := game.GetActivePlayers()
isComplete := game.IsBettingRoundComplete()
```

### Hand Evaluation

```go
// Evaluate a player's best hand
result := EvaluatePlayerHand(player, game.CommunityCards)

fmt.Printf("Hand: %s\n", result.Description)        // e.g., "Full House"
fmt.Printf("Rank: %d\n", result.Rank)               // Numeric rank for comparison
fmt.Printf("Value: %d\n", result.Value)             // Tie-breaking value
fmt.Printf("Cards: %s\n", result.Cards.String())    // Best 5-card hand
```

## 🎯 Hand Evaluation Features

### Comprehensive Rankings
The evaluator supports all 10 standard poker hand rankings:

1. **Royal Flush** - A-K-Q-J-10 all same suit
2. **Straight Flush** - Five consecutive cards same suit
3. **Four of a Kind** - Four cards of same rank
4. **Full House** - Three of a kind + pair
5. **Flush** - Five cards same suit
6. **Straight** - Five consecutive cards (including A-2-3-4-5)
7. **Three of a Kind** - Three cards same rank
8. **Two Pair** - Two different pairs
9. **One Pair** - Two cards same rank
10. **High Card** - No other combination

### Advanced Features
- ✅ **Low Ace Straights**: Properly handles A-2-3-4-5 straights
- ✅ **Best Hand Selection**: Finds best 5-card hand from 7 available cards
- ✅ **Tie Breaking**: Sophisticated value calculation for comparing equal ranks
- ✅ **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful handling of insufficient cards
- ✅ **Combination Generation**: Efficient algorithm for generating all possible 5-card hands

## 🎮 Game Flow

1. **Create Game**: `NewGame()` with player names and blinds
2. **Start Hand**: `StartHand()` deals cards and posts blinds
3. **Player Actions**: `Call()`, `Raise()`, `Check()`, `Fold()`

5. **Phase Advancement**: `NextPhase()` moves through betting rounds
6. **Hand Evaluation**: `EvaluatePlayerHand()` determines winners
7. **Next Hand**: `NextHand()` moves dealer button

// Uses poker.Card for individual cards
```

### With `holdem_ai` package:
```go
// Provides Game and Player types for AI decision making
// Hand evaluation used by AI for strategy
// Game state queries used for bot logic
```

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

Building on this solid foundation:
